The database design for a ticket-selling management system.

## Description

Information systems play a pivotal role in shaping the success of various business models, events, and arrangements. They serve as the backbone, facilitating their development, implementation, and smooth operation. In doing so, these systems guarantee efficiency, accuracy, and overall effectiveness. The profound impact of harnessing information systems for superior outcomes is exemplified by the Qatar 2022 World Cup. This global event has harnessed a diverse array of information systems, resulting in an unparalleled experience for both players and a worldwide audience.

One standout instance of this is the World Cup's ticket-selling system, which is underpinned by a robust and integrated information system, boasting a well-structured database. This database plays a pivotal role in collecting crucial data from the audience. This data, in turn, becomes instrumental in tailoring services and experiences throughout the host city based on attendance numbers.
